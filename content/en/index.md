The NLUUG is the association of (professional) Open Systems and Open Standards users in the Netherlands. Since the late seventies, the NLUUG has brought together the community of systems administrators, programmers, researchers and IP network professionals. The primary goal of the NLUUG is to extend the application of, and knowledge about, open systems and UNIX.

NLUUG is focused on the Netherlands, which means that our communication is usually in Dutch. Conferences tend to have about half of the presentations in English. Some speakers offer to speak English at the start of their talks. Most speakers have their slides in English.
