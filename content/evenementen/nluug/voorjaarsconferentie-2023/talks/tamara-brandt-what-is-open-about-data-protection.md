## Abstract

At first glance, the word protection combined with the word open seems like a paradox. However, there is much to be gained from transparency with respect to protecting personal data. The sharing of data, under the right conditions, therefore lies at the heart of today's European data protection legislation. How is your data protected by transparency? What are the requirements of the law and why? How does this work out practically in the organization?

A story that starts from a piece of theoretical background and works towards practical tips that can be applied to any organization that processes personal data.
